# ZaligVinder
This is an **unofficial** but friendly fork of the ZaligVinder string benchmark set/runner, presented in the paper [The Power of String Solving: Simplicity of Comparison
](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3387903.3389317).

Official sources are available at https://git.zs.informatik.uni-kiel.de/dbp/wordbenchmarks. I think. It has no README.

My end goal is to have a nice, standards-compliant Python 3 package you can install with pip3 and use to setup your benchmarks.

I plan on experimenting with it and possibly try to get my changes merged upstream, though I will change almost all aspects of the code formatting and am unsure if the original authors would be ok with that. I was also not super happy registering on a random university Gitlab instance to maybe possibly send a PR at some point in the future.

In other words: if you are looking for the real ZaligVinder benchmarking tool, this ain't it. If you are the original authors: I will get in touch with you about merging this if I ever feel like I have something worthwhile!
